This was my first project at CodeClan. The brief was as follows:

**MoneyCashboard
You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.**



I chose this brief as I found it the most relatable problem in my life. I love to travel, usually on a tight budget and have not found an app that tracks my spending easily by day. I decided to tailor my money tracker app towards travellers.

This project helped to consolidate my learning in the following areas:
- Ruby fundamentals
- Test Driven Development
- Object Orientated Programming
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

I wrote my models in Ruby, the database in SQL and used the Sinatra web server for the app. The front end was done in HTML and CSS.

The homepage shows the user their budget for the trip, their spend so far and how much under/over budget they are. They can then navigate to another page to input a transaction. They can also view transactions for a certain vendor, category or date.

This project helped me understand a lot about databases and how tables can interact with one another. It taught me a lot about working to a deadline and how to prioritise my workload.

One of the biggest challenges for me was the planning. I planned well at the start but for future I would like to be more dynamic with my planning and adapt it as I go along.
